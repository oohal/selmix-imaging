function [ret err] = ZaberMoveRelative(device, devNr, relativePosition, varargin)
% MoveRelative - Moves the device by the positive or negative number of
% microsteps specified in the Command Data.
% 
% The device moves to a position given by its current position plus the
% value specified in the command data. The relative move command data in
% microsteps can be positive or negative. The final position must be
% between 0 and Maximum Position (specified by Set Maximum Position
% (cmd 44)), or an error code will be returned. The device begins to move
% immediately, and sends a response when the move has finished.
% 
% The target speed and acceleration during a move absolute instruction can
% be specified using Set Target Speed (Cmd 42) and Set Acceleration
% (Cmd 43) respectively.
% 
% All move commands are pre-emptive. If a new move command is issued before
% the previous move command is finished, the device will immediately move
% to the new position. If a Move Relative command is issued while the
% device is currently moving due to a previous command, the device will
% immediately set a new target position equal to the current position
% (at the instant the command was received) plus the specified relative
% position.
% 
% This command may pre-empt, or be pre-empted by Move to Stored Position
% (Cmd 18), Move Absolute (Cmd 20), Move Relative (Cmd 21), Move at
% Constant Speed (Cmd 22) and Stop (Cmd 23).
