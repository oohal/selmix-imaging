Most of this code was written by Dominik Hofer and is covered by the BSD license as found in license.txt. The code was modified to use pause() instead of busywaiting with cputime but it is otherwise identical.

The zaber_*.m functions are some utility functions specific to this project and are not part of Dominik's distribution.
